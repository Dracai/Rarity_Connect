        Hi my name is Jakub Pawluczuk and I created this forum. I wanted to create a place that people with
        rare illnesses or mental issues could come together and help eachother out. My mom suffers from 2
        rare illnesses and she was my motivation to make this forum as I think that there isn't enough places
        for people to get help or just talk about their experiences. If people just want peopleto talk to or
        they want to connect with people that have the same issues as them, I hope everyone will
        something for them here ! If there is something we can help with please visit the Contact Us page and
        I will be glad to help.
